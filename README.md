# dotemacs
My emacs setting based on:

1. https://github.com/zilongshanren/.emacs.d

2. https://gitee.com/mickey991/emacs-config/tree/master (for latex setup)

3. https://config.phundrak.com/emacs/

4. https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/emacs-config/blob/main/wttr-weather.el (init- weather, works better for me than wttrin-emacs)

and other sources (spacemacs, doom...)  on the internet. 

It is still under construction, use it at your own risk.
