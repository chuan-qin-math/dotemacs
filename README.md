# dotemacs
My emacs setting based on:

1. https://github.com/zilongshanren/.emacs.d

2. https://gitee.com/mickey991/emacs-config/tree/master/init.el (for latex setup)

3. https://config.phundrak.com/emacs/

and other sources (spacemacs, doom...)  on the internet.

Need to do:

M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts (if some modeline fonts are missings)

It is still under construction, use it at your own risk.
