# dotemacs
This is my emacs setting used for macOS system(x86_64 or arm64), not tested for windows or linux, based on:

1. https://github.com/zilongshanren/.emacs.d (basic setup)

2. https://gitee.com/mickey991/emacs-config/tree/master/init.el (for latex setup)

3. https://config.phundrak.com/emacs/

and other sources (spacemacs, doom...)  on the internet.

(14/04/2025) Stop using pdftools, change to eafpdfviewer for reading + skim for TeX.
Need to do:

M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts (if some modeline fonts are missings)

It is still under construction and there may be some bugs, use it at your own risk.
